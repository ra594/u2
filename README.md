# Instagram Follower Analyzer

This tool compares the follower and following lists from your Instagram data.

## Using the App

1. Upload your first Instagram ZIP using the form on the main page. The ZIP
   filename should look like `instagram-<username>-YYYY-MM-DD-*.zip`.
2. After the results are displayed, click **Upload New Data** to add additional ZIP files whenever you have a new snapshot.
3. Each upload is stored as a run using the creation date embedded in the ZIP
   metadata (not the filename). New entries that didn't exist in the previous
   run are marked with a **NEW** badge in the results pages.
4. Click **Clear Data** to remove all stored runs and reset both upload forms.
