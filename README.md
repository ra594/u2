# Instagram Follower Analyzer

This tool compares the follower and following lists from your Instagram data.

## Using the App

1. Upload your first Instagram ZIP using the form on the main page. The ZIP
   filename should look like `instagram-<username>-YYYY-MM-DD-*.zip`.
2. After the results are displayed, a simple **Add Run** form appears below them. Use this to upload additional ZIP files whenever you have a new snapshot.
3. Each upload is stored as a run with the extracted date. New entries that
   didn't exist in the previous run are marked with a **NEW** badge in the
   results pages.
4. Click **Clear Data** to remove all stored runs and reset both upload forms.
